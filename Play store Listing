Want to design a padeye in under 5 seconds with a detailed PDF report and drawing ?

Padeye Design app automatically designs an optimized Padeye in seconds based on just five inputs. Provide padeye safe working load, sling angle, out of plane angle, factor of safety and the type of padeye. And click Calculate. Padeye design DONE!

The app automatically selects suitable shackle, sling, optimum plate thickness and gives out a completely designed padeye compatible to latest industry code and practices.

If necessary, the designed padeye can also be modified by changing parameters to suit specific requirements and available inventory.

Further, Settings section can be used for changing the parameters that control the padeye design algorithm with geometric width, geometric length, plate thickness constraints.

Detailed Features :-
- Intuitive user interface and functionalities
- Automatic design of stiffened / unstiffened padeyes
- Automatic selection of plate thickness and grade
- Automatic selection of shackle and approximate sling diameter
- Detailed professional design calculation report with drawing in PDF format
- Automatic padeye drawing generation
- Open, share, save PDF report in any of your favorite suitable apps
- Instantly share report, drawing using email, whatsapp or any suitable apps
- Ability to change any aspect of the designed padeye & recalculate to suit specific needs
- Ability to influence design algorithm by providing geometric, plate thickness constraints
- Provide plate thickness, geometric length and width limitations in settings
- Reports other suitable shackles
- Shackle database up to 1800 MT (Crosby, Greenpin and GN)
- Search shackle by model name or working load limit
- Designed using best industry practices and guidelines
- Supports API-RPA-2A WSD, AISC
- Beautifully animated graphs for various stress ratios
